## Hi, I’m John Garner.
I’m a learner, designer, and software engineer. I helped found a company building the future of institutional storytelling with backing from Kleiner Perkins and clients ranging from pre-seed startups to the Fortune 500. My work has been featured by the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Adobe, and Macalester College.
