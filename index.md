## About me
I’m a highly detail-oriented, human-centered designer who strives to improve the lives of people in this world. I feel joy when a well-crafted product adapts to my needs, improves my quality of life, and functions elegantly. This is what I pursue in my work.

I have experience in:
- Product, Graphic, and UX/UI Design
- Software Development
- Photo and Video Editing
- A wide variety of tools and languages including Figma, Adobe Creative Cloud, React, JS, Python, HTML, and CSS

I’ve been a YouTuber, achieving roughly 1,000,000 views and a student of Macalester College, graduating with a BA in Computer Science, Data Science, and Studio Art.

I enjoy spending my free time scuba diving, reading, traveling, playing a variety of instruments (primarily the piano), and learning Slovene. [Hvala!](https://translate.google.com/?sl=sl&tl=en&text=Hvala!)
